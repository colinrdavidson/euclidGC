TODO
-would like to add potential points as hidden views, can easily do this
by inheriting from PointView and just adding a hover over event
-I think we need a good way of finding corresponding views and models,
can do this using x ys i think
-if we have this, then we can easily add potential points and slurpies
and stuff i think... 
-make a bunch more images for point colours, also a transparent image,
it feels bad but I don't have another way to get the imageviews for
potential points to work off the top of my head, as i think that setting
the visibility of a view off turns off events as well.
